What we are investigating, in this project, is whether, and to what extent, a significant amount of audios from these churches can be useful as a linguistic resource for developing NLP systems in Ghanaian local languages. The value of this exploration lies in the fact that this resource is something we can get in significant amounts quite cheaply and quickly. Thus, if we can show it to be useful as an NLP resource, we would have found a feasible way to get enough data to build NLP systems in Ghanaian languages for, at least, certain tasks. Some recent works have looked into
